Zoledronic acid is an intravenous bisphosphonate used to increase bone mineral density and reduce the risk of fractures. Its safety profile compares well with pamidronate in pediatric patients. We describe an acute, severe, life-threatening, inflammatory reaction in a child. A 7-year-old boy with complex medical problems and chronic ventilator requirements was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (due to ventilator needs) for zoledronic acid infusion and subsequent monitoring. His history was significant for osteoporosis secondary to immobilization with multiple fractures since 2 years of age, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, quadriplegic cerebral palsy, seizure disorder, ventilator dependence, and pulmonary hypertension. He had previously been treated with four cycles of pamidronate without adverse events. He received 0.013 mg/kg of zoledronic acid infused over 30 minutes. Beginning 3 hours after completion of the infusion, he developed progressive tachycardia, fever, hypotension requiring vasopressor infusion, and increasing oxygen requirements. Laboratory studies revealed leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated C-reactive protein, abnormal coagulation profile, metabolic acidosis, and negative cultures. The following day, he developed moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary hemorrhage requiring higher ventilatory settings, and subsequently diarrhea and abdominal distension. Initial clinical resolution was noted from the third day onward, and he was discharged on the sixth day after zoledronate administration. Our pediatric patient demonstrated an acute, severe, life-threatening reaction to zoledronic acid requiring intensive cardiorespiratory support without an underlying pre-existing inflammatory disorder. Our case highlights the importance of careful monitoring of children following zoledronic acid therapy. We recommend inpatient observation after an initial infusion of zoledronic acid in medically complex children. Children and their parents should be thoroughly counseled on the potential risks of bisphosphonate treatment, which can sometimes be severe and life threatening. [PMID: 26892041, S Trivedi et al., 2016] Zoledronic acid (ZA), a highly potent intravenous bisphosphonate (BP), has been increasingly used in children with primary and secondary osteoporosis due to its convenience of shorter infusion time and less frequent dosing compared to pamidronate. Many studies have also demonstrated beneficial effects of ZA in other conditions such as hypercalcemia of malignancy, fibrous dysplasia (FD), chemotherapy-related osteonecrosis (ON) and metastatic bone disease. This review summarizes pharmacologic properties, mechanism of action, dosing regimen, and therapeutic outcomes of ZA in a variety of metabolic bone disorders in children. Several potential novel uses of ZA are also discussed. Safety concerns and adverse effects are also highlighted. [PMID: 29184807, Sasigarn A Bowden et al., 2017] The third generation bisphosphonate zoledronic acid has demonstrated efficacy in reducing skeletal-related events in adult patients with multiple cancer types that have skeletal disease. The use of zoledronic acid in pediatric oncology patients with bone metastases for the purpose of reducing pain, improving bone strength and altering the progression of metastatic disease has not been thoroughly evaluated. From October 2005 to December 2008, 19 patients at the Aflac Cancer Center received one or more doses of zoledronic acid as part of their therapy. A retrospective review of these patients was performed and information was collected including indication for treatment, toxicities, and outcomes. Most patients (n = 15) received zoledronic acid following relapse of their malignancy with metastatic disease present in one or more bony sites. Hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia were frequent, but did not result in clinical symptoms. More significant toxicities associated with zoledronic acid, including clinically apparent renal insufficiency and osteonecrosis of the jaw, were not seen. Overall, zoledronic acid was well tolerated in this population. The benefits of zoledronic acid seen in randomized trials of adults with bone metastases have sparked interest in its use for children with metastatic cancer. The administration of zoledronic acid in pediatric oncology appears safe, and may result in improved bone strength and pain control. Further evaluation is warranted to prospectively evaluate its efficacy and long-term safety in pediatric patients with cancer and skeletal metastases. [PMID: 21298747, Keith J August et al., 2011] Zoledronic acid or zo/edronate is a potent bisphosphonate that recently has been used in children with osteoporosis and osteogenesis imperfecta (01), so it could be an option in the treatment of children with this terrible disease that virtually condemns them to a life of pain and prostration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and biochemical conditions of pediatric patients with 01 before and after treatment with zo /edronate. We included 14 patients, median age six years (6 months to 14 years), eight (57.1 %) males and six (42 .9%) females, weight 19 kg (5.8-45 kg). According to the type of 01, six (42.9%) were type I, six (42.9%) type Ill, and two (14.2%) type IV The functional score (Bleck) previous to treatment was 4 (1-9) and 6 (2-9) after treatment (p = 0.001). Pain intensity prior to zo/edronate was 2 (1-9) and 0 (0-2) after (p = 0.008). Previous fractures five (1-15) and post-treatment one (0-2) (p = 0.001 ). There were no significant differences in calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and parathyroid hormone. Zoledronic acid decreases the number of bone fractures and pain in children with osteogenesis imperfect and improves functional status. The most common side effects were fever and bone pain within five days after the infusion,which disappear paracetamol. No adverse long-term effects such as hypocalcemia or hypoparathyroidism were reported. [PMID: 25946526, Luz María Sánchez-Sánchez et al., ] Pediatric patients with Crohn's disease often have low bone mass (osteopenia) for age. No randomized, placebo-controlled trials using zoledronic acid have ever been performed in this population. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of zoledronic acid in children with Crohn's disease and osteopenia. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design was used. Thirteen adolescents received either a single intravenous dose of zoledronic acid (0.066 mg/kg, max 4 mg, n= 7) or saline placebo (n= 6). The primary outcome was change in lumbar spine bone mineral density (LSBMD) z-score at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included bone markers and adverse events. At 6 months, the change in LSBMD z-score was significantly higher in the zoledronic acid group compared to placebo (0.7 vs 0.1, P < 0.001). Volumetrically adjusted LSBMD z-score also significantly increased in the treated group. This significant difference persisted until 12 months. With zoledronic acid, urinary C-telopeptide excretion decreased by 50% at 6 months and remained suppressed at 12 months (P= 0.02), but no changes were observed with placebo. Both groups had similar adverse events which included transient fever, arthralgias, and nausea (3/7 treated, 2/6 placebo, P= NS). In this study, zoledronic acid demonstrated a significant increase in LSBMD at 6 and 12 months following a well-tolerated infusion. [PMID: 20524999, Anne Marie Sbrocchi et al., 2010] Previous reports have shown a high frequency of hypocalcaemia and flu-like symptoms following an initial first zoledronic acid dose of 0.02-0.025 mg/kg in children. We systematically evaluated the mineral status and symptomatology of 63 children with a variety of bone disorders treated with an initial zoledronic acid dose of 0.0125 mg/kg. The Mann-Whitney U test, chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test were used as appropriate. 0.0125 mg/kg zoledronic acid reduced the incidence and intensity of hypocalcaemia but not the incidence of the flu-like symptoms compared to higher doses. Within the low dose cohort, flu-like symptoms were associated with an acute inflammatory response. Children who became hypocalcaemic received a higher dose in relation to their body mass index and body surface area. Reducing the initial zoledronic acid dose in children decreased the incidence of hypocalcaemia and thus improved safety. Dosing on the basis of body mass index or body surface area instead of body weight may further reduce the incidence of hypocalcaemia. [PMID: 17574945, Craig F Munns et al., 2007] Zoledronic acid (ZA) is an intravenous bisphosphonate used to treat pediatric osteoporosis. Adverse events including hypocalcemia and acute phase reaction (APR) are common following first-infusion. The purpose of this report is to describe implementation of a ZA clinical practice guideline and the subsequent process changes to improve adherence to aspects of the protocol related to safety and efficacy. Quality assurance was evaluated by chart review over a 5-year period to compare the prevalence of hypocalcemia and APR to published data. A quality improvement (QI) initiative consisting of process changes including the addition of an endocrine RN to coordinate infusions and a shift to patient/family self-scheduling of infusions was conducted. The effect of the interventions on safety (completion of pre- and post-infusion bloodwork) and efficacy (receipt of all prescribed infusions) outcomes was evaluated. Seventy-two patients received 244 infusions over the period. The frequency of hypocalcemia (22%) and APR (31%) was consistent with prior reports. 99% of patients received pre-infusion bloodwork, 78% received post-first-infusion bloodwork, and 47% received all prescribed infusions. QI initiatives increased the percentage of patients receiving post-first-infusion bloodwork from 67 to 79% and those receiving all infusions from 62 to 74%, but fell short of the goal of 90%. The implementation of a standardized protocol for ZA use in children was successful in confirming patient eligibility with pre-infusion bloodwork but failed to ensure that patients obtained post-first-infusion bloodwork and received all prescribed infusions. Further efforts to systematize the management of children on ZA are needed. [PMID: 33825940, David R Weber et al., 2021] Osteoporosis is a systemic disease characterized by decreased bone density and increased tendency to develop fractures. Osteoporosis in children and adolescents is a rare disease usually secondary to Medical conditions or medications given to children. The condition affects normal bone growth and development and carries with it multiple morbidities (physical and psychological) if not corrected promptly. This study aims to share our experience with Zoledronic Acid Therapy in Pediatric patients with secondary osteoporosis. A retrospective study which included 46 patients aged 3 to 18 years. All patients received specific doses of Zoledronic acid and were followed up at King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Clinical and laboratory data were collected for each patient from their files. Adverse events were also recorded. The use of Zoledronic Acid in children and adolescents appears to be statically significant reduce fracture rate (p=0.005), bone turnover markers (Osteocalcin p= 0.003, CTX p= 0.008) and pain frequency in symptomatic individuals (p=0.000). Careful selection of cases is required to provide maximum benefits compared to risks associated with therapy. This study demonstrates that Zoledronic acid has positive effects on clinical outcome and bone marker level as well as quality of life for Pediatric patients with Osteoporosis and their families, with no long-term side effects. [PMID: 27045392, Abdulmoein E Al-Agha et al., 2016] To highlight the clinical benefit, efficacy, and safety of zoledronic acid (ZA) therapy in children and adolescents with primary and secondary osteoporosis. This is a retrospective observational study of 131 children and adolescents visiting the Pediatric Endocrine Clinic at King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, between January 2002 and January 2015. Clinical and laboratory data were collected for each patient and adverse events were evaluated. The mean patient age was 11.43 years. There was a significant decrease in the number of fractures after ZA treatment for primary osteoporosis (p=0.000) and in secondary osteoporosis (p=0.005). There was a significant decrease in both osteocalcin (p=0.001) and C-terminal telopeptide (p=0.003) in patients with primary osteoporosis, as well as osteocalcin (p=0.003) and C-terminal telopeptide (p=0.008) in patients with secondary osteoporosis after treatment. The use of ZA in children and adolescent appears to have favorable effects on fracture rate and quality of life, including pain and mobility in symptomatic individuals. Intravenous ZA is comparable to other bisphosphonate agents in its efficacy and safety and features a more convenient infusion protocol with no documented long-term complications, thus, we advise its use in pediatric population. [PMID: 26593164, Abdulmoein E Al-Agha et al., 2015] Limited evidence is available concerning experience with use of zoledronic acid (ZA) and treatment for conditions other than primary bone fragility. A retrospective review of all Royal Children Hospital patients who had been administered at least 1 dose of intravenous ZA from 2002 to 2015 was undertaken. The audit included 309 children with 228 being treated for bone fragility conditions. Of the 228, 68 had height-adjusted lumbar spine bone mineral density Z-scores available over up to a 5-year period, and median increases were +2.0 SD (median absolute deviation = 0.9) (N = 36, p value for median increase of at least 0.5 in Z-score <0.001), for patients with osteogenesis imperfecta or other primary bone fragility disorders, +1.0 SD (0.9) (N = 14, p = 0.029), for immobility conditions, +0.5 SD (0.7) (N = 10, p = 0.399), and for glucocorticoid-induced secondary osteoporosis, +0.7 SD (0.6) (N = 8, p = 0.015). 81/309 children were treated for bone abnormality indications (e.g., avascular necrosis [AVN], fibrous dysplasia, and bone cysts). Of 39 with AVN, outcome data were available for 33, with joint integrity maintained for 24/33 from 6 to 24 months after last ZA, subjective reports (22/28) of reduced pain. Reduction in bone lesion size was seen in 2/4 patients with bone cysts within 12 months of ZA commencement. This is the largest cohort of reported outcomes of ZA use in a paediatric population. Results demonstrate a good efficacy profile and associated improved bone density for osteoporotic conditions and stabilization of non-traumatic AVN with a low rate of joint collapse. [PMID: 33508822, Angelina Lim et al., 2020] Zoledronic acid (ZA) is increasingly used in young patients with bone disorders. However, data related to the safety of ZA administration in this population are limited. The study aimed to characterize the short-term safety profile of ZA and identify risk factors for ZA-related adverse events (AEs) in young patients. This was a retrospective chart review of inpatients and outpatients less than 21 years old who received at least one ZA infusion between July 2010 and January 2014 at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Eighty-one patients (56% male; median age, 12 y; age at first infusion, 0.5 to 20 y) with diverse skeletal disorders received a total of 204 infusions. The most common indications were osteoporosis (33% of cohort) and osteogenesis imperfecta (27.2%). The median ZA dose was 0.025 mg/kg (interquartile range, 0.025-0.05); the median dosing interval was 6 months (range, 1 to 25.6 mo). AEs were mild and more common after the first ZA infusion in patients with no previous bisphosphonate exposure: hypophosphatemia (25.2% of infusions), acute phase reactions (19.1%), and hypocalcemia (16.4%). Symptomatic hypocalcemia requiring iv calcium occurred after two infusions. ZA dose was significantly associated with hypophosphatemia, but not other AEs. Hypocalcemia was more common in patients with high bone turnover as assessed by preinfusion alkaline phosphatase levels. AEs were not associated with diagnosis, baseline serum calcium, or calcium/calcitriol supplementation. Acute AEs related to ZA infusion in youths are common, occur principally after the first ZA infusion in bisphosphonate-naive patients, and are typically mild and easily managed. Future prospective studies are needed to determine the potential long-term risks, as well as benefits, of ZA therapy in the pediatric population. [PMID: 26308295, Sobenna George et al., 2015] To study the safety and efficacy of zoledronic acid treatment in children with osteoporotic bone disorders. Observational study in 22 patients with osteogenesis imperfecta and related conditions who were treated at our institution with zoledronic acid. These patients had initial treatment with pamidronate. Lumbar spine z-scores, annual change in areal bone mineral density, bone mineral adjusted density, fracture number and linear growth before and after zoledronic acid treatment was commenced were compared. Patients were treated for a mean of 3.4 years with zoledronic acid after a mean of 3.75 years of pamidronate therapy. There was no difference in areal bone mineral density accrual in the first year of zoledronic acid treatment compared to the preceding year of pamidronate treatment. Lumbar spine z-scores and bone mineral adjusted density continued to increase with zoledronic acid. Number of fractures during treatment was significantly reduced compared to baseline with either bisphosphonate, with no difference between treatments. Linear growth was not affected. Zoledronic acid is at least as effective as pamidronate as treatment for paediatric osteoporosis, and has a similar safety profile. [PMID: 19344075, J J Brown et al., 2009] Zoledronic acid, a bisphosphonate, delays progression of bone metastases in adult malignancies. Bone is a common metastatic site of advanced neuroblastoma. We previously reported efficacy of zoledronic acid in a murine model of neuroblastoma bone invasion prompting this Phase I trial of zoledronic acid with cyclophosphamide in children with neuroblastoma and bone metastases. The primary objective was to determine recommended dosing of zoledronic acid for future trials. Escalating doses of intravenous zoledronic acid were given every 28 days with oral metronomic cyclophosphamide (25 mg/m(2)/day). Toxicity, response, zoledronic acid pharmacokinetics, bone turnover markers, serum IL-6, and sIL-6R were evaluated. Twenty-one patients, median age 7.5 (range 0.8-25.6) years were treated with 2 mg/m(2) (n = 4), 3 mg/m(2) (n = 3), or 4 mg/m(2) (n = 14) zoledronic acid. Fourteen patients were evaluable for dose escalation. A median of one (range 1-18) courses was given. Two dose limiting toxicities (grade 3 hypophosphatemia) occurred at 4 mg/m(2) zoledronic acid. Other grades 3-4 toxicities included hypocalcemia (n = 2), elevated transaminases (n = 1), neutropenia (n = 2), anemia (n = 1), lymphopenia (n = 1), and hypokalemia (n = 1). Osteosclerosis contributed to fractures in one patient after 18 courses. Responses in evaluable patients included 1 partial response, 9 stable disease (median 4.5 courses, range 3-18), and 10 progressions. Zoledronic acid pharmacokinetics were similar to adults. Markers of osteoclast activity and serum IL-6 levels decreased with therapy. Zoledronic acid with metronomic cyclophosphamide is well tolerated with clinical and biologic responses in recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma. The recommended dose of zoledronic acid is 4 mg/m(2) every 28 days. [PMID: 21671363, Heidi V Russell et al., 2011] To evaluate the efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid in children with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). Descriptive Study. National Institute of Child Health, Department of Endocrine and Diabetes, Karachi, Pakistan, from January 2011 to December 2020. Children, with OI registered for the treatment, were included. Zoledronic acid was given to them by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 0.05 mg/Kg/day for a median duration of 60 (24-96) months. To ensure safety, patients were kept for 24 hours after dose administration to monitor any short-term side effects. The patients were assessed after every 3-6 months for frequency of fracture, bone pain, and BMD. Out of 82 children [40 females (48.8%) and 42 males (51.2%)], 11 patients (13.4%) had fever and 2 patients (2.4%) had flu-like illness. No other side effects were observed. The annual fracture rate decreased overall from 2.8±1.5 to 0.2±0.5 (˂0.001) in both males (2.6±1.3 to 0.1±0.4) and females (3.1±1.7 to 0.2±0.6). Z-score on DEXA scan showed improvement in BMD overall (-3.9±2.0 to 2.2 ±1.7), in males (-3.7±1.9 to -2.1±1.7) and in females (4.1±2.1 to -2.3±1.8). There were no other long-term side effects like ocular problems, osteonecrosis of the jaw, and delayed healing of the fractures. Zoledronate use in children is associated with minimal short-term and long-term side effects with a significant improvement in BMD and decline in fracture rate. Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), Bisphosphonates (BPs), DEXA scan, Bone mineral density (BMD). [PMID: 36089714, Maira Riaz et al., 2022] Osteogenesis imperfecta is an inherited clinically heterogeneous disorder of bone metabolism characterized by bone and skeletal fragility and an increased risk of fractures. Pamidronate infusion was the standard treatment, but zoledronic acid is increasingly used to treat children with osteogenesis imperfecta. We conducted a systematic literature review to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous zoledronic acid in the treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta in pediatric patients. A systematic review of the published literature was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Eligible articles were clinical trials and observational studies including pediatric patients (<16 years) with osteogenesis imperfecta treated with zoledronic acid. We selected articles published during the 20 past years. The selected languages were English and French. We included articles with a minimum sample size of five patients. Six articles fulfilled the selection criteria. The majority of patients were Chinese (58%). The predominant sex was male (65%), and the age of included patients ranged from 2.5 weeks to 16.8 years. For all patients, zoledronic infusions were administrated intravenously. The zoledronic treatment duration ranged from 1 to 3 years. Densitometry parameters before and after zoledronic treatment were evaluated and showed significant improvement both in lumbar spine-bone mineral density Z-score and femoral neck-bone mineral density Z-scores. A significant decrease in fracture rate has also been noted both in vertebral and nonvertebral fracture incidence. The two most common side effects were fever and flu-like reactions. None of the patients presented severe adverse events. Zoledronic acid appeared to be well-tolerated and effective in the treatment of pediatric osteogenesis imperfecta. [PMID: 37339526, Ines Mahmoud et al., 2023] Severe hypercalcemia associated with vitamin D intoxication or malignancy in children is a rare and life-threatening condition. There is little published experience with Zoledronic acid in the treatment of pediatric severe hypercalcemia. Here, we present two pediatric cases of severe hypercalcemia, one due to vitamin D intoxication and the second to malignancy, in which Zoledronic acid was used as the first-line bisphosphonate in the treatment. While both cases responded well to a single dose of Zoledronic acid, the second case experienced hypocalcemia requiring calcium treatment after Zoledronic acid infusion. Our report shows that Zoledronic acid may be an effective option in the treatment of severe pediatric hypercalcemia, although patients should be followed closely after infusion due to the risk of hypocalcemia. We provide additional published evidence for the effectiveness of Zoledronic acid in correcting severe pediatric hypercalcemia and hope this will encourage future studies with larger numbers of patients. [PMID: 36264042, Fatih Kilci et al., 2022] The clinical side effects of the potent new bisphosphonate zoledronic acid in children are unknown. In this study of 34 children with various bone disorders, the frequency of postinfusion flu-like illness, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia was 85%, 74%, and 82%, respectively. No renal side effects were detected after up to 3 consecutive infusions. [PMID: 15520785, Wolfgang Högler et al., 2004] Zoledronic Acid is a bisphosphonate used in a 4-week schedule for the treatment of bone metastases. Some randomized trials supported its role also when administered every 12 weeks. we performed a systematic review and a meta-analysis in order to evaluate the two different schedules in terms of skeletal morbidity rate (SMR), skeletal related events (SRE) and adverse events (AEs). our results showed a clinical difference favouring the 12-week schedule in terms of AEs (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.06-1.29). No signifcant differences were found for SMR (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.84-1.13) and SRE (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.89-1.16). Our findings support in clinical practice the 12-week schedule an alternative to the standard 4-week schedule in advanced breast and prostate cancer, in particular when the clinical comorbidities of the patients suggest a higher risk of renal failure or hypocalcaemia. [PMID: 31377434, Daniele Santini et al., 2019] Both bone metastases and fragility fractures due to bone loss result in considerable morbidity affecting quality of life and independence as well as placing complex demands on healthcare resources. Zoledronic acid is a widely used intravenous bisphosphonate that reduces this skeletal morbidity in both benign and malignant conditions. The incidence, clinical importance and prevention strategies to minimize side effects associated with the use of zoledronic acid are discussed with a particular focus on use in oncology where intensive monthly scheduling is required. This potentially increases the risk for adverse events over the 6-12 monthly administration used to treat benign bone diseases. A detailed understanding of the generally favorable safety profile of zoledronic acid, but particularly the potential for renal dysfunction and osteonecrosis of the jaw. When compared to many other therapies, especially in the cancer setting, the severity of adverse events related to zoledronic acid is generally mild and, with the exception of the acute phase response causing transient fever, myalgia and bone pain, side effects are infrequent. Thus, the benefits of treatment with zoledronic acid within its licensed indications almost always outweigh the risks. [PMID: 21114419, Robert Coleman et al., 2011] There are limited data on the use of bisphosphonate therapy for secondary osteoporoses in childhood, and no previous reports of the use of zoledronic acid in this group. We report 20 children with a variety of underlying primary diagnoses with associated secondary osteoporosis, who were treated with 3 monthly zoledronic acid for 2 years (annualised dose 0.1mg/kg/year). There was a significant improvement in lumbar spine (by 1.88 SD±1.24 over first 12 months, p<0.001) and total bone mineral density as assessed by dual energy absorptiometry (DXA) scans, with a similar increase in bone mineral content for lean tissue mass (mean increase 1.34 SD in first 12 months, p<0.001). Bone turnover was reduced with a suppression of both osteocalcin and alkaline phosphatase in the first 12 months of treatment. Skeletal architecture was improved, with increased second metacarpal cortical thickness from 2.44mm to 2.72mm (p<0.001) and improved vertebral morphometry, with 7 patients who had vertebral wedging at baseline showing improved anterior (p=0.017) and middle (p=0.001) vertebral height ratios. Aside from well reported transient side effects with the first dose, there were no adverse effects reported. No adverse effects on anthropometric parameters were seen over the course of the study. Despite all patients having sustained fragility fractures prior to treatment, no fractures were reported during the study period. Further evidence is required to confirm efficacy, with long term follow up required to assess the impact of treatment on fracture risk. [PMID: 21820091, Peter J Simm et al., 2011] Zoledronic acid (Zometa, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) is a new generation of bisphosphonates (BPs) with demonstrated clinical benefit in breast and prostate cancer patients with bone metastases. The safety and efficacy of intravenous zoledronic acid in lung cancer patients was assessed. In 86 patients with newly diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and bone metastases, 4 mg of zoledronic acid was administered with rapid 15-minute intravenous infusion every 3-4 weeks. A total of 414 infusions were administered over a 24-month period during which a statistically significant decrease in serum calcium levels (p = 0.03) was observed. Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) also decreased but not significantly. With regard to clinical efficacy, 55 of our patients stabilized or reduced their need for analgesic treatment. No significant side-effects, including fever, hemodynamic instability and renal dysfunction, were seen. We conclude that the rapid infusion of zoledronic acid is safe and convenient for lung cancer patients even after the 3rd and 6th months follow-up. [PMID: 18383897, Elias Kotteas et al., ] Zoledronic acid has been marketed for the past 5 years for the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy and malignant bone disease in patients with multiple myeloma or a broad range of solid tumors. The safety profile of zoledronic acid in this patient population is well established from the databases of several large, randomized, Phase III trials and postmarketing clinical experience. Zoledronic acid is well tolerated, with predictable side effects, primarily transient flu-like symptoms, which are manageable with standard treatment. Renal monitoring is recommended, with dose reductions for patients with renal dysfunction. Monitoring for electrolyte imbalance is also important as is calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Ocular complications are rare, and osteonecrosis of the jaw is uncommon and might be avoidable with appropriate dental care. [PMID: 17480179, Allan Lipton et al., 2007] Zoledronic acid (Zometa), a third-generation amino-bisphosphonate, has been approved in the US, the EU and many other countries worldwide for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases of malignancy. In several well designed trials, zoledronic acid 4 mg administered as a 15-minute infusion every 3-4 weeks was effective in reducing the occurrence of skeletal complications in patients with bone metastases secondary to multiple myeloma, breast cancer or prostate cancer. Zoledronic acid was as effective as pamidronic acid in reducing the occurrence of skeletal complications in patients with multiple myeloma or breast cancer. In patients with solid tumours other than breast or prostate cancer, zoledronic acid did not show significant clinical benefit over placebo in terms of the primary endpoint; however, some benefit of therapy in terms of secondary endpoints was observed with zoledronic acid relative to placebo. Its efficacy in a broad range of tumours and short infusion time (15 minutes) are an advantage over other available bisphosphonates. Modelled pharmacoeconomic analyses in patients with breast cancer suggested that zoledronic acid therapy is cost effective relative to no therapy with regard to the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained; however, results were mixed when zoledronic acid was compared with other commonly used bisphosphonates. Zoledronic acid is generally well tolerated; the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw may be minimized by adhering to recommendations regarding dental therapy. Additional efficacy and economic data are required to definitively position zoledronic acid with respect to other bisphosphonates. Nevertheless, available clinical data indicate that zoledronic acid is an effective treatment option for the management of bone metastases of malignancy. [PMID: 18318568, Sohita Dhillon et al., 2008] The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of zoledronic acid compared with placebo in preventing bone mineral density (BMD) loss and suppressing bone markers when initiated during the first year of androgen deprivation therapy in patients with locally advanced prostate cancer. Patients were randomized to receive zoledronic acid 4 mg or placebo intravenously every 3 months. Lumbar spine (LS) and total hip BMD was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline and at week 52. N-telopeptide (NTX) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) were evaluated at baseline and every 12 weeks. Safety assessments were performed throughout the study. Efficacy analyses included 106 patients and 109 patients in the zoledronic acid and placebo groups, respectively. At week 52, the least squares mean BMD percentage differences were 6.7% for LS and 3.7% for total hip (P < 0.0001 for both). In the zoledronic acid group, decreases in NTX ((-)14% to (-)28%) and BSAP ((-)31% to (-)37%) levels were significant and sustained; changes in NTX levels and LS BMD (r = (-)0.25; P = 0.04) and in BSAP levels and hip BMD (r = (-)0.28; P = 0.02) were significantly correlated. Only traumatic fractures were reported for 2 and 3 patients receiving zoledronic acid and placebo, respectively. One patient in each group experienced acute renal failure. Osteonecrosis of the jaw was not reported. Zoledronic acid (4 mg intravenously every 3 months) was safe and effective in preventing bone loss and reducing bone turnover in patients with prostate cancer when initiated during the first year of androgen deprivation therapy; patients with low baseline BMD experienced the greatest benefit. [PMID: 17553207, Ron S Israeli et al., 2007] Patients with metastatic bone disease often have severe bone pain and debilitating skeletal complications. Zoledronic acid is the only bisphosphonate shown to be safe and effective in reducing skeletal-related events (SREs), including pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, and radiation or surgery to bone in patients with bone metastases from advanced prostate cancer or renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In both tumour types, zoledronic acid significantly decreased the overall risk of developing an SRE, delayed their onset and significantly reduced the incidence of SREs compared with placebo. In patients with RCC, zoledronic acid also significantly delayed the time to progression of bone lesions by 5 months compared with placebo. Zoledronic acid is safe and well tolerated with long-term use. [PMID: 16225510, Fred Saad et al., 2005]
